              <p>
              Hello! Welcome to my career transition journey! I am a <b> Certified Clinical Research Coordinator </b> (CCRC/ACRP) 
              and <b> Certified Health Education Specialist </b> (CHES/NCHEC). In 2008 I moved from VA to NC for a Social/Clinical Research Specialist postion 
              working on an obesity prevention study called "Way to Health." 
              <br/> <br/>
              Several years later I secured another Social/Clinical Research Specialist postion this time in a Radiation Oncology department within an academic
              medical center where I coordinated numerous research studies with individuals undergoing radiation and/or chemotherapy for cancer treatment.
              Eventually though I felt stagnant in this position as there was no room for professional growth. 
              <br/> <br/>
              After 5 years I left that position in 2017 for a new one, this time in a different aspect of clinical research but unfortunately it just wasn't a good fit.
              The universe and my own misery were both telling me it was time for a CHANGE. I'd heard about <a href="https://www.momentumlearn.com/"> Momentum, </a> 
              a computer coding/programming bootcamp in Raleigh-Durham, NC and decided to check it out. It peaked my interest! I had experience in creating 
              and maintaining websites in my previous postions and had always really enjoyed it. 
              <br/> <br/>
              After doing a lot of research on how coding skills might complement and enhance my clinical reasarch skills and the prospect of employment 
              in the tech field, I really started to consider transitioning my career to tech. With Momentum's great community outreach via social media, I attended 
              a local Meetup crash-course in coding in June 2018. Yep, still interested!
              <br/> <br/>
              Now, keep in mind, I've been interviewing for several new positions during this time. Although these jobs will provide paycheck and a some project     managment and team management experience, the learning curve is short and the professional ceiling very low. 
              <br/> <br/>
              Knowing the committments required to attend the full bootcamp program of 3 months (financial and sans paycheck), I'm still not ready to make a commitment.
              Thankfully Momentum offers a 2-week Coding Foundations course prior to the start of the full-immersive program in a few weeks. A perfect fit! And so,
              this blog begins........ <hr/>

              <div>
              <p>
                The Coding Foundations class covered these fundamentals: 
                 <ul>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                  <li>CSS</li>
                  <li>JavaScript</li>
                  <li>Intro to Command Line</li>
                 </ul>
                I picked up parts of the languages easily but functions in JavaScript are still a tricky concept. I know it all comes with practice.  At least I still   have 2 weeks until the fully immersive bootcamp starts and I plan to use the time to practice with free online courses offered by  
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a> and others. I know I am capable of learning the skills but I'm nervous about the pace and hope I can keep up! Wish me luck! <hr>

              <h3>
                July 26, 2018: Cohort Welcome Party
              </h3>
              Momentum's Welcome Party for the new cohort was so well organized! 
              Let's face it, you're dealing with a bunch of (seemingly) semi-anti-social people, putting them in the same room for the first time and expecting them to socialize? Riiiiight.....So they took the guesswork and anxiety out of the situation altogether. From name tags, to personal introductions, to a general introducations via a well-faciliated "Two Truths and a Lie" icebreaker. Well done!

              <h3>
                July 30, 2018: Momentum's Fully Immersive Coding Bootcamp (Week 1)
              </h3>
              <h4 class="day-titles">
                <strong>Day One</strong>
              </h4> <br/>
              I'm as prepared as I feel I can be to start this bootcamp. I've completed numerous language tutorials via CodeAcademy (Git, Command Line) and the mobile app version of <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank">SoloLearn</a>:
            <ol>
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>Ruby</li>
              <li>SQL</li>
            </ol>
            I also borrowed from my local library <a href="https://catalog.wakegov.com/" target="_blank">(WCPL)</a> the suggested book <strong>Learning How to Learn</strong> by Barbara Oakley, PhD and Terrence Sejnowski PhD and completed the very similiar <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn" target="_blank">Coursera</a> course. I'm ready, let's do this! <br/>
            The morning commute was overcast and rainy but it was also the best 45 minutes I've ever spent commuting on I-40 and 147 North thanks to the 
            <a href="https://gotriangle.org/maps-schedules/gotriangle/drx" target="_blank">Durham-Raleigh Express (DRX) route</a> provided by
            <a href="https://gotriangle.org/" target="_blank">Triangle Transit.</a>
            
            Class began with a 30-minute orientation to Momentum and the <a href="https://americanunderground.com/" target="_blank">American Underground.</a>
            Lecture began promptly at 9:30 with an introduction to HTML and a little CSS. I am so thankful for the opportunity to take the Coding Foundations class! It definitely made for a GREAT first-day!

                <strong>Day Three</strong> 
              </h4><br/>
              Teaching improvements: 
              <ul>
                <li>Don't spend too much time answering advanced questions from those who have more than beginner experience; 60 seconds or less is more than adequate.  It may make others feels less competent and uses class time that doesn't benefit everyone.</li>
                <li>Hands-on walk-throughs of lab/homework are more efficient and beneficial than trouble-shooting one student's particular problem. This would serve several purposes:</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Keeps everyone on the same page.</li>
                    <li>Allows each students to learn where they made mistakes.</li>
                    <li>Reviews and solidifies the material for those who understood it initially.</li>
                    <li>Reduces the langugage barrier, both the techincal language for newbies and those with English as a non-native language.</li>
                  </ol>
                <li>Don't use multiple shortscuts when writing example code. Write code like a beginner would, individually, stet-by-step.</li>
                <li>Defintely provide AMPLE lab time when introducing Git, GitHub, and CMD line.</li>
                <li>Just watching an instructor live code is not effective. It would be better to present the concept then have a working, hands-on example in class for students to code i.e. responsive design lecture.</li>
            </ul>
